**Main Research questions**

>   While there are plenty of parking solutions available in Sri Lanka there in none of them are providing
>     an optimal solution for the user problems. Mainly we identified some major issues with those systems
>     and real-world problems which users have to face when they use a private vehicle for the day to day
>     travelling.
>     When we consider existing parking applications, their parking packages are not much fair for the
>     vehicle owners. If someone wants to park the vehicle in a parking lot, they must have to choose a
>     package. According to the literature survey, we were able to find that many parking systems charging
>     at least per hour basis even if the vehicle driver use the parking for five or ten minutes. As a result,
>     drivers waste their money for those parking systems. In this solution we are introducing time based
>     subscription packages for the users which is charge for the exact parking time.
>     Although there are so many available parking lots in urban areas. We found that there is a lack of
>     well-organized parking lots available everywhere in the country. Some of the places are actually not
>     suitable for the parking but people used to park those places frequently because of not having parking
>     lot nearby beside the road and unauthorized or unsuitable places. So using this solution we are
>     registering verified parking lots to the system to avoid such problems.
>     Most parking areas in urban cities have very hard internal routing system, as a result driver face
>     difficulty to find the path to navigate inside the parking area. And, when we consider about parking
>     area owners, planning an optimal parking plan for their parking area is a hard task to them. Most
>     importantly there are various kinds of vehicles as a result some vehicle couldn’t enter some parking
>     areas due to different physical reasons such as over-height. And also, sometimes there will be no
>     free space to park when the user enter the park yard to park the vehicle, then the users will lost his
>     time and as well as emission of Carbon Dioxide and wastage of fuel may result in danger to human
>     in the near future. When a user arrives at the destination parking facility and come into a car
>     park facility indoor area, indoor navigation is launched to direct the user to the reserved parking
>     space.

>     In this parking system we provide business opportunity to the users to register to the system who
>     have owned empty land or garage. In that scenario they have to register giving relevant information
>     and pictures of the place he wants to register. System has a feature to verify the place as a proper
>     parking lot and approve the registration. Or else respective registration should direct to the human
>     verification by system admin. Then system admin have an ability give a proper parking mapping to
>     the parking owner with help of the system.


        • Verification and registration of the owner’s lands/home car park in the system(Research
        Component)
        • Suggesting the Optimal Parking mapping for the new parking lot to the parking lot owner

>     Finding a correct parking yard to park the vehicle is a hard task. In this component we are
>     going to suggest the most suitable parking yard for user by considering distance, availability
>     of free spaces and physical characteristics of vehicle such as height and width

    
        • Suggesting the most suitable parking yard for the driver(Research Component)

>     This proposed system needs to find the free parking spaces currently available (real-time) inside a
>     parking area to suggest the parking area for user, to decide the best parking space and to give the
>     user internal navigation inside car park. Member 3 mainly does this task. Also, this system gives the
>     parking area owner to feature of complaining about users misusing the system. In some cases there
>     are vehicles owners who live or work at some parking area’s building so they must have the ability to
>     park their vehicles for free when the owner of the parking area mentioned. There will be a proper
>     registration procedure for vehicle owners to the system. Furthermore, this system provides free
>     parking for registered users for free parking facility.

    
        • Identify free parking spaces inside a parking area(Research Component)
